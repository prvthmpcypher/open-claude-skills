"""Find skills whose triggers collide, and say which phrases they collide on.

Not TF-IDF. Cosine similarity over descriptions was tried first and fails on
this corpus: `chief-financial-officer` and `fp-and-a-analyst` score 0.219 and
never surface, because they collide on the concepts they *claim* (which live in
the body) rather than on description vocabulary. Feeding bodies to TF-IDF makes
it worse - shared boilerplate ranks unrelated pairs highly.

What works is a rare-n-gram concept-collision index. Extract multi-word phrases,
keep only those owned by a handful of skills (a phrase in one skill is that
skill's own territory; a phrase in thirty is a domain word), and score each pair
by how rare its shared phrases are. The output is a worklist naming the literal
colliding phrases, which is what you actually need to write a "Do NOT use for"
boundary.

Usage:
    python scripts/overlap.py                          # markdown worklist
    python scripts/overlap.py --min-score 4            # longer tail
    python scripts/overlap.py --json > work/overlap.json
    python scripts/overlap.py --regress work/overlap.json    # after the rewrite
