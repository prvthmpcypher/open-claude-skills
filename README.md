## Meta

`skills-meta` holds skills that operate on the library itself rather than a domain:
- **skill-router** — finds the right skill + repo for a described task, with the install command.
- **skill-linter** — checks a draft SKILL.md against house conventions before it's committed.
- **prompt-library-curator** — maintains versioned prompt template libraries across teams.

---

## Install

This repo is an index and a plugin marketplace. It contains no skills itself — each category lives in its own repo.

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add prvthmpcypher/skillary
/plugin install skills-finance@skillary
```

### Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and 70+ other agents

`npx skills` reads the manifests in these repos, so no custom installer is needed:

```bash
npx skills add prvthmpcypher/skills-finance
npx skills add prvthmpcypher/skills-finance/fp-and-a-analyst   # one skill
npx skills add prvthmpcypher/skills-finance -g                 # user-global
```

### Manual

Clone the **category** repo, not this one, then copy the folder you want:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prvthmpcypher/skills-finance
cp -R skills-finance/skills/fp-and-a-analyst ~/.claude/skills/
```

| Agent | Personal | Project |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/skills/` | `.codex/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| VS Code / Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `.github/skills/` |

`.agents/skills/` is the emerging vendor-neutral path that several agents read.

### Claude.ai
Every skill ships a `<skill-id>.skill` bundle. Upload it via **Settings → Capabilities → Skills**.

---

## Conventions

All skills adhere to the official **Agent Skills Specification** (`agentskills.io`):

```text
skill-id/
├── SKILL.md       # Metadata + Progressive execution instructions
├── references/    # Optional: Deep domain references (loaded on-demand)
├── scripts/       # Optional: Executable automation scripts
└── assets/        # Optional: Schemas, templates, fixtures
```

`scripts/` and `assets/` are part of the spec but are not yet used across this library.

## Quality

A file-level audit of all 315 skills in August 2026 found that the release labelled "v2.0 — production-grade" was not accurate. Everything it found has since been fixed:

| Defect | Was | Now |
|---|---:|---:|
| Skills shipped as import-failure stubs | 30 | 0 |
| Wrong-domain QA checklists (finance skills verifying that code compiles) | 281 | 0 |
| Descriptions over the ~250-char listing limit, trigger clause cut off | 228 | 0 |
| Descriptions ending in generated boilerplate | 180 | 0 |
| Triggers that just restate the skill's own name | 148 | 0 |
| No trigger clause in the visible part of the description | 60 | 0 |
| Reference files the body never links, so they can never load | 13 | 0 |

Enforced by `scripts/validate.py`, which reports zero findings across all 315 skills. Run it yourself:

```bash
python scripts/validate.py
```

Skills that overlap each other now name their sibling in the description (`financial-analyst` says "Not for budget-vs-actual variance work — use `fp-and-a-analyst`"), so routing between similar skills is deliberate rather than arbitrary. `scripts/overlap.py --regress` enforces that.

Still open: no skill ships `scripts/` or `assets/` yet, so every skill is instructions rather than executable capability.
